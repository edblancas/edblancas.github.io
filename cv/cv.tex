		\begin{cvsubsection}{}{}{}
			\begin{itemize}
					\item In 2010 I graduated from Engineering in Computer Technologies and received a full scholarship (CONACYT and Tec de Monterrey) to study a Master’s Degree in Computer Science, that I finished later in May 2012. Both degrees were awarded by the ’Tec de Monterrey’, Mexico City Campus.

	\begin{cvsection}{Employment}
		\begin{cvsubsection}{Senior Software Engineer}{Nubank}{May 2021 -- Nov 2023}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Built the screens and flow that customers use to apply for a personal loan in the Nu application; which resulted in the release of the first MVP for Mexico and the internationalization of the services architecture that worked both for Brazil and Colombia. Clojure, Datomic, BDC, and Flutter.
				\item Designed, and built the architecture that would enable the backend for the issue of personal loans; this includes the creation or internationalization of services. Clojure, Kafka, Datomic, and K8s.
				\item Built a solution in the fraud vertical that helped to decrease in 15\% the time spent by customer service to process customers that could be identified as potential fraudsters. Clojure, ClojureScript, Kafka, Datomic, and K8s.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{cvsubsection}

		\begin{cvsubsection}{Full Stack Engineer}{Rappi}{Jul 2019 -- May 2021}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Coaching a small team to migrate the old microservices to a new event-based architecture mainly with Kotlin (Spring Boot) and Kafka, but we also used TypeScrpit (NestJS); that resulted in a more robust infrastructure that powers the Colombian's RappiPay B2B ecosystem. PostgreSQL, Jenkins, and K8s.
				\item Built a solution, with Airflow and Python3, that helped in the day-to-day settlement transactions processed by RappiPay systems with Rappi's debit card. This led to an automated process and a more precise and rapid resolution to tens of thousands of support tickets for Mexico and Brasil. Pandas, Snowflake, K8s.
				\item Developed new features in the RappiPay vertical, which helped to stabilize the functioning of the platform and make more attractive the use of Rappi's debit card. Node.js, JavaScript with Express/Koa, PostgreSQL, and K8s.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{cvsubsection}

		\begin{cvsubsection}{Software Engineer}{AMK Technologies}{Jun 2017 -- Sep 2018}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Led the design and development of a high-demand API for registering users to entertainment subscriptions, this helped the company attract new clients. So clients could do their own advertisement of new products and subscribe users using the API. Spring (Core, JDBC), Dropwizard, HBase, Kafka, MySQL, MongoDB, Java 11, Maven, TDD, AngularJS, Angular 2+, React/Redux, and Docker.
				\item Standardized creation of the frontend projects. React, Redux.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{cvsubsection}

		\begin{cvsubsection}{Software Engineer}{Indigo}{Sep 2016 -- Jun 2017}		
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Supervised the frontend codebase (AngularJS) for Bansefi back office, implementing and teaching best practices, clean code, and incremental refactoring. Bootstrap 3, Java, SQL Server, MyBatis, and WSO2 Application Server.
				\item Solved the need to process big CSV files of inventory for Bansefi, by implementing a batch process (Spring Batch) and printing PDF reports with Jasper Reports.
				\item Led the redesign and development of a ``Flights and Hotel Reservation'' Ruby on Rails project, that was staled for almost half a year, because there was no Ruby developer. So I had to organize meetings with the previous developer, and then do weekly meetings with the client to report advance and clarify doubts. Culminating in the successful end-to-end tests that implied third-party APIs. PostgreSQL, Redis, and NGINX.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{cvsubsection}
		
		\begin{cvsubsection}{Software Engineer}{Glider Software Solutions}{May 2012 -- Sep 2016}	
			\begin{itemize}

Resulting in a more maintainable and extensible codebase. Java, J2EE, Oracle Data Base, Oracle Weblogic, Oracle Business Process Management, Oracle Service Bus.
				\item Migration of the Citibanamex frontend system for opening new accounts, from FLEX to HTML (JavaScript/jQuery).
				\item Led the development of a new CIBanco project called ``Multicurrency'', proposing the use of the Grails framework (Groovy). In the end, the project was successfully integrated with the internal REST services and help to achieve the deadline date.
