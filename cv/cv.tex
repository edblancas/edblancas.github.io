		\begin{cvsubsection}{}{}{}
			\begin{itemize}
					\item In 2010 I graduated from Engineering in Computer Technologies and received a full scholarship (CONACYT and Tec de Monterrey) to study a Master’s Degree in Computer Science, that I finished later in May 2012. Both degrees were awarded by the ’Tec de Monterrey’, Mexico City Campus. Apart from the educational background, I’m a fan of the gadgets, I like video games and also, I’m a geek of the terminal and VIM.

Other technologies used: PostgreSQL, Jenkins, and K8s.
			\end{itemize}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Built a solution, with Airflow and Python3, that helped in the day-to-day settlement transactions processed by RappiPay systems with Rappi's debit card. This led to an automated process and a more precise and rapid resolution to tens of thousands of support tickets for Mexico and Brasil. Other technologies used: Snowflake, K8s.
			\end{itemize}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Developed new features in the RappiPay vertical, which helped to stabilize the functioning of the platform and make more attractive the use of Rappi's debit card. Technologies used: Node.js, JavaScript with Express/Koa, PostgreSQL, and K8s.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{cvsubsection}

		\begin{cvsubsection}{}{Personal Time}{Sep 2018 -- Jul 2019}
			\begin{itemize}

				\item Solved the need of process big CSV files of inventory for Bansefi, by implementing a batch process (Spring Batch) and printing PDF reports with Jasper Reports.
			\end{itemize}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Led the redesign and development of a ``Flights and Hotel Reservation'' Ruby on Rails project, that was staled for almost half a year, because there was no Ruby developer. So I had to organize meetings with the previous developer, and then do weekly meetings with the client to report advance and clarify doubts. Culminating in successful end to end tests that implied third party API's.
