		\begin{cvsubsection}{Full Stack Engineer}{Onest}{Sep 2024 -- Present}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Developed the back-end and front-end systems to support personal loans in underdeveloped markets, incorporating gamification and financial education to boost customer engagement.
				\item Developed microservices using TypeScript, Node.js, and Express.js while leveraging the AWS ecosystemâ€”including Lambda (later migrated to Kubernetes), S3, DynamoDB, and Kafka. These services utilize an event-driven architecture for asynchronous communication alongside REST APIs for synchronous operations, significantly enhancing system scalability and resilience.
				\item Designed and built a back-office system from scratch using React with Redux, and RTK Query to improve performance.
				\item Developed a custom notification system that schedules timely alerts for payment due dates and overdue accounts, using DynamoDB to store a history of sent messages for audit purposes.
				\item Established CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and implemented unit and integration tests to ensure that the services function correctly before automatically deploying them to development or production environments.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{cvsubsection}

		\begin{cvsubsection}{Sr Full Stack Engineer}{Nubank}{May 2021 -- Nov 2023}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Built the screens and flow that customers use to apply for a personal loan in the Nu application; which resulted in the release of the first MVP for Mexico and the internationalization of the services architecture that worked both for Brazil and Colombia. Clojure, Datomic, BDC, and Flutter.
				\item Designed, and built the architecture that would enable the backend for the issue of personal loans; this includes the creation or internationalization of services. Clojure, Kafka, Datomic, and K8s.
				\item Built a solution in the fraud vertical that helped to decrease in 15\% the time spent by customer service to process customers that could be identified as potential fraudsters. Clojure, ClojureScript, Kafka, Datomic, and K8s.
			\end{itemize}
		\end{cvsubsection}

		\begin{cvsubsection}{Sr Full Stack Engineer}{Rappi}{Jul 2019 -- May 2021}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Coaching a small team to migrate the old microservices to a new event-based architecture mainly with Kotlin (Spring Boot) and Kafka, but we also used TypeScrpit (NestJS); that resulted in a more robust infrastructure that powers the Colombian's RappiPay B2B ecosystem. PostgreSQL, Jenkins, and K8s.
				\item Built a solution, with Airflow and Python3, that helped in the day-to-day settlement transactions processed by RappiPay systems with Rappi's debit card. This led to an automated process and a more precise and rapid resolution to tens of thousands of support tickets for Mexico and Brasil. Pandas, Snowflake, K8s.
				\item Developed new features in the RappiPay vertical, which helped to stabilize the functioning of the platform and make more attractive the use of Rappi's debit card. Node.js, JavaScript with Express/Koa, PostgreSQL, and K8s.
